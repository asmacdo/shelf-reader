Shelf Reader is a tool for libraries that retrieves call numbers of items 
from their barcode and determines if they are in the correct order. This
allows library staff to quickly and accurately scan their shelves for items
that are out of place.

This script interfaces with a required csv file that contains the barcode
and call number of each item.
